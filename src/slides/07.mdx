# New components & hooks

- Layout components like `Center`, `Container`, and `Wrap`
- Utility hooks like `useBreakpointValue`, `useControllableState`, `useToken`
- Complex components have been rebuilt to rely on hooks that provide data,
  callbacks, and accessibility props
  - Hooks like `useAccordion`, `useMenu`, etc.
  - Component hooks are exported so you can use them to extend Chakra component
    behavior and accessibility with your own custom component implementations
